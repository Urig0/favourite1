        <p>Hobby is an activity that can be done in the free time.<br>
            I like to read because I also like to write stories; so I can get some idea to write the story. Reading a book increasing someone's vocabulary. Even we can read anything for just timepass. I like to read even for a break from anything, like studying or anything. Books also increase anybody's knowledge if the book is type of encyclopedia or a textbook, etc. Keep writing and reading, ofcourse and thankyou. </p>
